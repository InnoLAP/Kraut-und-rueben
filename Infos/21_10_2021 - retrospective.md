# 21/10/2021 - Retrospective


## Liked
* Lauren: We advanced a lot on the codes
* Lauren: Everyone had a chance to help and code something for the project
* Paul: It was a great decision to let the 2 of you control the designs since they look amazing üëç
* Paul: We made some rapid progress this week
* Alex: fast progress of the project

## Learnt
* Lauren: Communication is essential. We need to always communicate what are we working on and remember to PUSH the changes
* Lauren: SCSS and other CSS stuff
* Paul: A lot about dynamic SQL commands within php
* Alex: tools: Xampp, Git, html, php, css

## Lacked
* Lauren: I'm sticking a lot to my comfort zone, working with HTML and I should push myself to try things with PHP too
* Paul: I think everything is going according to plan ü§î
* Paul: We should keep this pace even on the weekend if possible since we still miss every connection from the actually designed  page and the db
* Lauren: I didn't communicate well at the beginning of this week - started working on the FE and didn't share the changes
* Alex: background of scripts

## Action points
* Keep the pace!
* Communicate & Push
* Daily standups beginning next monday!
